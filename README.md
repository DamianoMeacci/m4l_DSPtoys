"A small collection of Max for Live devices

Some algorithms built in recent years mainly for live electronics performances. These algorithms are generally not particularly complex but are immediate and functional.

## Chaotic Delay
A delay algorithm with feedback that produces irregular and even unpredictable results due to delay times that vary within a predetermined range. The algorithm also includes the possibility of using multiple outputs where different delay lines are distributed with multichannel configuration.

## Freeze FFT
A fun Freeze FFT algorithm with four instances of recording and playback.

## Infinite Glissando
A real-time reconstruction of the classic Shepard-Risset algorithm.

## Pitch Shift
A pitch shifter, based on the classic gizmo~ object, designed for use in live contexts.

## Resonant Filters
A bank of resonant filters with various interesting functions.
